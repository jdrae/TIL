<h1 id="threading-with-python">Threading with Python</h1>
<p>Originally, python program runs with a <strong>single thread</strong>. That is, one main thread execute a code in order. It’s because python has <strong>Global Interpreter Lock</strong> to run specific code at one point. And this rule restrict python to implement multiple codes concurrently in multi core CPU environment. To run python code synchronously, it’s required to use <strong>multiprocessing</strong> or <strong>threading</strong> module, otherwise python will implement the code by <strong>interleaving</strong>.</p>
